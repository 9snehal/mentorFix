# MentorFix

MentorFix is an open source initiative to find mentors for people around who have certain projects in mind but need people/volunteers to bring those into life.

> Be what you wanted your mentors to be for you.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Your machine should have NPM, NodeJS and Meteor installed to use MentorFix locally. A full guide for installing each of these is given below:

```sh
# Ubuntu
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

```sh
# Windows
Windows users need to download the installer from Official NodeJS and Meteor site and run it with administrator privileges.
```

```sh
# macOS
brew install node
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

To check NodeJS and NPM has been installed run on terminal or command prompt

```
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/WrippleFoss/mentorFix
$ meteor npm i
```

### Run locally

```
$ meteor run
goto http://localhost:3000
```
